Barcode Segmenter is a tool that crops out barcodes from larger images.

Dependencies:

* Camellia at http://camellia.sourceforge.net/
* Camellia Ruby Gem at http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/30340/camellia-2.7.0-x86-linux.gem
* Mini Magick at http://github.com/bmo/mini_magick/tree/master
* ImageMagick at http://www.imagemagick.org/


OSX installation is tricky and is described here:
http://po-ru.com/diary/camellia-and-ruby-on-mac-os-x/
(also see comments)

How does it work:

It uses the Camellia Image detection engine to isolate barcode-like blobs in an image. A contiguous area of such blobs is then isolated and cropped off the main image.

To use:

ruby barcode_segmenter.rb test/medium2.bmp medium-segmented.bmp

Important:

All input should be a 24-bit truecolor BMP image, convert using (for e.g.):
convert input.jpg -depth 24 barcode_for_processing.bmp
(convert is installed when you install ImageMagick)

You can pass any ImageMagick supported filetype as the output.

To debug:

Just pass "debug=true" as the third parameter, for e.g:
ruby barcode_segmenter.rb test/medium2.bmp medium-segmented.bmp debug=true
